              For this assignment, the only deliverable was a full usability
              test document. This included writing a script, having students
              test it with three people, and writing a conclusion based upon
              those usability tests. Usability testing is done to determine the
              way everyday people would use a program, typically in its
              prototype phase. As programmers, the sequence of events to be able
              to complete a task is extremely obvious. To customers, this is
              rarely ever the case. In conducting a usability test, shortcomings
              in the usability are brought to life. Things that are supposed to
              be easy to the user are tested to see if they truly are or not,
              and it also gives insight into how an everyday user would use the
              program for the tasks they are assigned. Questions that are
              created are not meant to lead users towards one answer or another,
              but instead, ask for feedback on how their experience is going.
              Students had to be sure to take into account several things, such
              as background information the users might have, experience with
              similar products, as well as being sure that any users involved
              understand their responses are anonymous, but will be used by the
              design team to improve the product. Students then conducted these
              tests based off of the wireframes they created for Assignment 2.

              This was another assignment where I was a little bit intimidated
              by the social requirement, however, learning from the first
              assignment, I was a lot more prepared. Usability tests are
              extremely important during the development cycle as it helps
              significantly in knowing whether or not the current trajectory of
              a product or a feature of a product works with the target
              audience. Typically conducted by UX researchers, it involves
              getting people in a room to actually test what is being designed
              and/or created. When it comes to feedback on how to improve my
              design, I’ve actually found this to be one of the most useful
              methods of gaining feedback. It’s so easy to hand something to
              somebody and ask them what they think. More often than not, that
              will lead to a rather vague answer, as people are generally
              empathetic and don’t like to hurt others feelings. Sadly, when it
              comes to improving products, that’s never really useful. Instead,
              putting them through the process of actually interacting with the
              product really gives the insight that people need. Even simply
              being able to observe somebody using a product gives so many
              useful insights that otherwise wouldn’t be gotten through a simple
              survey. For example, being able to see the amount of time someone
              takes figuring out their next task can tell if it’s too easy or
              too hard.

              One super interesting piece of feedback that I got during my
              usability tests surrounded a feature in my wireframe that I hadn’t
              expected to gain as much praise as it did. I had introduced a
              “send to phone” feature in my wireframe. To me, it just simply
              seemed logical. In today’s day and age, being given a set of
              directions often leads to them being forgotten and people getting
              lost. I wanted to include a way to connect to the existing
              technology that I had found out in my persona that people already
              used quite heavily – their phone. This actually led to one of my
              usability participants praising it from an accessibility
              perspective, as forgetting actually tends to be a crippling
              downfall. Even within a small space, having a back-up to the human
              memory (which is known to fail) was extremely beneficial. I also
              got a lot of good feedback that my design was super consistent and
              nice to use, which made me feel rather good. Learning more about
              iconography was also an unintended benefit of this usability test
              that I got, which helped me improve my design for the final
              assignment.

              If I were to do this assignment again, I would have liked to go
              much more in-depth with my conclusion. I felt like I really didn’t
              go as deep into it as I could have. I got a lot of number-based
              answers, which I could have gone much more in-depth with my
              interpretation of. Instead, I feel like I left it rather general,
              taking all of the positive praise, and not going nearly as
              in-depth with the suggestions. There is a lot of room for
              improvement with any design, and there were certainly some subtle
              suggestions I could’ve accounted for. I also think I would have
              asked better questions, as I really feel like I just asked the
              same thing over and over. I don’t really like repetition, so
              trying to vary things up a bit more is definitely an area I could
              have improved in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, I don’t think I’ll ever be conducting another
              usability test. However, I certainly will still be using them in
              the future. They’ll be the basis on which I provide suggestions,
              or even program them. They have such a vital role in the design
              process that I am sure I will encounter them again. Of course, it
              is also entirely possible that I end up in a UX researcher role,
              and then I’ll probably be conducting more than a few of them. The
              value that a usability test has also is something that I plan on
              using in future projects. I was able to learn that I take a lot
              more value in being able to gain the feedback a usability test
              gives than simply a questionnaire. There is so much information
              that they give to the development team, being able to harvest all
              of that is certainly difficult. I really enjoyed noticing the
              subtle things, such as how long people took to figure out a path,
              how they made the connections, and how they interpreted what was
              in front of them. No person will ever interpret it in the exact
              same way as somebody else, and actually, that was really useful in
              being able to improve my design. There were consistencies between
              quite a few of the tests which completely threw off my
              expectations, but were extremely important in the feedback. So
              while I’m not a fan of having to sit people down to test a
              product, I know there’s so much value to a usability test, I’ll
              certainly be using it in some way or another in the future.
