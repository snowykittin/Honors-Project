              This assignment included one main deliverable: a wireframe of the
              kiosk that students were asked to provide in the scenario for
              Assignment 1. The main purpose of a wireframe is to allow teams to
              better understand the visual product in a bare-bones format.
              Wireframes are typically extremely low-fidelity, meaning that they
              lack the visual flare that most finished products have. This is
              intentional, as their purpose is mainly for internal use.
              Wireframes can even be completed on paper, although online
              resources such as Whimsical have become popular for online
              wireframe creation. Everyone has a different mental image when
              being described something, and a wireframe helps everybody ensure
              they are on the same page, as well as allow for better visual
              organization of information. For this assignment, students had to
              prototype one process the kiosk may be used for, such as booking
              an event.

              If I had to name an assignment that I would’ve been able to do
              without taking this class, this would have been the first one to
              come to mind. Wireframing has been something I’ve been doing for
              several years, and I have the most familiarity with it. I also
              have familiarity with using Whimsical, the application of choice
              for creating this. However, my knowledge of wireframing was not as
              in-depth as I attempted to go for this particular assignment.
              Adding comments about the specific interactions that could be made
              was something I had always annotated elsewhere instead of on the
              actual points of interaction themselves, which was a change that I
              will be taking into account for any future wireframes that I
              create. I also fell into the unfortunate category of trying to
              make my wireframes way too complicated, which I scaled back for
              this assignment. Being able to take an existing skill and hone it
              into something much more efficient, but also much more applicable
              to its actual purpose is something I always appreciate taking the
              time to do. My high school computer science teacher wasn’t as
              interested in the design side of things as I was, which meant that
              a lot of that I was left on my own to discover. Naturally, being
              an amateur, there will be quite a few mistakes that I make. This
              wasn’t a perfect wireframe either, but a significant improvement
              over ones I had made in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a skill that is particularly useful for my field. While I
              may not be directly be the one creating the wireframes, having the
              capability to essentially scaffold out a website and make the
              connections as to what it is intended to do is beneficial. Even in
              the instance of trying to just pitch an idea to the rest of my
              team, not everybody visualizes things in the same way, and having
              a method of being able to jot down the picture in my brain
              provides a massive advantage. Another nice perk to wireframing is
              that you don’t have to have any massive talent in the artistic
              department to be able to use it to your advantage. Anybody can
              draw a box and some circles, and hopefully everybody can write
              English. Those fundamentals essentially are what make up
              wireframes.

              If I went back and redid this assignment, I would probably choose
              an alternative path of interaction. I felt that choosing an event
              as my task didn’t leave me with too many good options for
              wireframing. There were some interesting features that I had
              eluded to, such as sending maps via QR code, that I could have
              fleshed out their use. Even showing the highly interactive map
              would have been another great path to wireframe. I think that
              being able to consider alternate alternatives is always important
              when reflecting on a project, and in the case of this one, I feel
              I took the easy way out. I also would have liked to better detail
              the interactions, taking advantage of more of Whimsical’s features
              in the process. There is a lot of room for improvement in regards
              to my wireframing skills, but overall, I feel rather good about
              how I did on this particular assignment. It’s extremely relevant
              to what I want to do in the future. I think I also would try to
              use another product, as I did find myself running into the
              limitations of Whimsical. For its purpose, it accomplished it, but
              if I were to go above-and-beyond, I’d need to use an alternative.
