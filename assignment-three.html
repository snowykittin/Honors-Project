              The deliverable for this assignment involved creating a Heuristic
              Analysis. A heuristic analysis is a report documenting how a
              website matches up to heuristics. Heuristics are mental
              short-cuts, a set of already existing connections that make
              navigating the world and making judgements much easier. These
              heuristics exist all around us in terms of computing. An example
              of such is the home button: almost everybody now has the heuristic
              that they expect a home button to be on the bottom center of a
              phone screen. Taking the time to have a heuristic analysis of a
              website conducted can allow for web masters to understand how
              their website might be making sense to them, but not to the rest
              of their customers. It gives the chance to identify shortcomings
              in the design on an organizational level. For this assignment,
              students were tasked with picking a website, and reporting on
              15-20 findings.

              I definitely had the most fun with this assignment. Having taken
              AP Psychology in high school, I already had an idea on that
              heuristics were. Applying that to the computing space opened up my
              eyes to just how many expectations people have when it comes to a
              program, a lot of which people don’t understand. A lot of the
              time, the reasons we find something to be ‘unaesthetically
              pleasing’ really comes down to the fact that it doesn’t fit any
              heuristics that we currently have. I chose to evaluate Craigslist,
              and given the age of the site, I knew that there would be quite a
              few findings. I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I found,
              though, and how little of those actually happened to deal with
              aesthetics. Such a well-known website actually had quite a
              significant amount of heuristic findings that had room for
              improvement. For its core purpose, craigslist serves it rather
              well, but a downside is that the overall website had attempted to
              expand into categories that it really didn’t need to. An example
              of this was their blog. For a website that has come to be known
              around selling items, having a blog just doesn’t make much sense.

              If I did this assignment again, I certainly still would have
              chosen Craigslist as my website. There was a lot of really good
              insights to take into account when I made my report, and I
              actually had a lot of fun. I had to think critically when finding
              things that seemed off to me. Trying my best when making
              recommendations, that was certainly my weakest point. Being able
              to pinpoint what all is wrong is easy, but giving solutions to fix
              it is what is much harder. I would work a lot more on giving
              better recommendations, and ideally, proposing 2-3 solutions for
              each problem that would be ranked from “easiest” to “most
              difficult.” I also would have really liked to try to pinpoint more
              findings on the pages that people are more familiar with. One of
              the uses of Craigslist that I am most familiar with is selling
              vehicles. The way those pages are set up is quite a bit different
              than a lot of the rest of the site, and while evaluating it as a
              whole certainly is important, focusing on the main purpose of the
              website would have been more beneficial. Of course, Craigslist
              probably won’t ever see my heuristic evaluation, but in attempting
              to mock real life, focusing on the primary objective of the
              website would have been a much better decision instead of saving
              it to be the couple of end findings.
            </p>

              Conducting a heuristic analysis is something that I actually don’t
              see myself doing in my professional career. Considering that I
              personally don’t find myself in a UX researcher role, it’s
              unlikely I’ll end up doing one. However, being able to complete it
              is still important. It gave me good insight into expectations that
              users have, as well as being able to detail solutions to problems
              that may occur. Given that I would ideally like to end up in some
              type of leadership position, that is often where people tend to
              ask for suggestions. If I am able to find out just what it is that
              doesn’t seem right to me, that just makes me critical. But being
              able to actually give reasons why it’s a problem, as well as the
              suggestions to fix them, changes it from just simply being a
              negative bit of feedback into a true suggestion people will take
              into account. Not a lot of people like to hear that they’ve made a
              mistake, and I am no stranger to that type of pitfall. However,
              most of us, hopefully all of us, are human. Imperfection is part
              of our nature, but striving to be better is an important quality
              that I hope to continue to push myself and other people to delve
              into.
