              This assignment takes everything into account from past
              assignments to put together a final UI. While not programmed, it
              serves as a simulation to the final product. In creating this
              final design, thinking of all recommendations gathered was
              extremely important. Students had to factor in feedback on their
              wireframes of Assignment 2, the original scenario that they had
              proposed in Assignment 1, any heuristics they may catch from
              having done Assignment 3, and most importantly, the feedback from
              users in Assignment 4. All of this information is important in
              creating the final design, as it shows they are capable of
              understanding feedback and implementing it into a design. No
              design is ever perfect, and as such, changes will be made. Another
              requirement that had to be met was creating an error screen. In
              life, nobody will ever follow the exact path that a programmer
              expects them to. As such, having error cases to handle when
              something goes awry is critical to ensure that users are able to
              fulfill heuristics of error prevention and error handling. People
              are not stupid, and as such, if you give them a problem, they will
              naturally want to find the solution. Overall, this assignment is
              to serve as a 'final' for the course, bringing everything together
              into one final product.

              Perhaps it was due to a few absences, but this was the assignment
              I felt had the least connection to the rest of the course. It
              certainly was a logical choice for the process we took, as the
              course essentially took students through the entire design
              process, just from a UX researcher’s perspective. However, the
              course mainly drove students to look at things from a UX
              perspective, and I feel that making a final design really don’t
              accomplish that. It seems much more like something intended for
              software designers instead of a UX researcher. I understand that
              it came from the idea of being able to take all of the feedback
              that was gained from the other assignments and turn the kiosk into
              something better, but again, it just doesn’t seem like much of a
              UX researcher’s thing to do. If anything, I certainly would have
              expected having to do a paper that was a massive proposal document
              to make the changes that were suggested along the way. Alongside
              making those suggestions, there would have to be the evidence from
              each assignment to support it along the way. Pulling things in
              like heuristics of the wireframe, the suggestions from the
              usability test, and even suggestions that were made simply from
              revisiting the design after having some time away from it. From my
              perspective, that would be much more applicable to a UX researcher
              than actually creating something off of those suggestions. After
              all, at least to my knowledge, UX researchers usually aren’t the
              ones who have to program the final product.

              When it comes to improving past assignments, this is the one that
              I certainly have the most amount of improvement that I could have
              made. Should I ever have the chance to redo this assignment, I’d
              essentially start from scratch. There is one massive pitfall that
              I have as a student, and even as a person: I tend to get rather
              lazy when I’m comfortable with the material. Many excuses come to
              mind when I think about the “why” behind it all. I think of things
              like having a grade buffer so I can afford to slack of a little
              bit, I didn’t have the time to complete it, I didn’t exactly know
              what to do. At the heart of all of these though is simply the fact
              that I get a bit lazy when I feel confident in knowing what I’m
              doing, and that was exactly what had happened with this
              assignment. I certainly could have done a much better job of
              prototyping the final UI from the wireframe, even with the
              limitations that Whimsical had. If anything, I feel like the kiosk
              is still in a beta phase, rather than a final UI design. I also
              would have taken the time to think the overall design out much
              more extensively. One thing that I did do for this assignment that
              I will certainly be attempting to do when referencing existing
              content in the future is I looked up the media package for the
              Indiana Convention Center. Being able to take resources from the
              already-existing source and implement them into a kiosk for that
              place is an important skill to have for a programmer, as more
              often than not, the programmer isn’t going to be the one actually
              designing the kiosk. They’re just going to program it and make it
              come to life.

              If there was any assignment that basically acted as a blanket
              statement to what I’m likely going to be doing for the rest of my
              life, this is it. As of this present moment in time, I see myself
              getting a job on the software programming side of things. That
              means taking already existing content, tweaking it to fit a set of
              objectives or suggestions, and delivering a final product. This
              also means it is the assignment that I should have put the most
              effort into, as it would make for a great portfolio item. However,
              given that I am very aware that I fell short of doing that for
              this particular assignment, it also taught me one of the largest
              lessons for this course. Funnily enough, it also fits in with one
              of the heuristics and lessons that I learned about in the class as
              well: Humans are naturally lazy. We want to take the least amount
              of steps and time to get something done, and we’re rather
              determined to do just that. Programmers are actually a testament
              to that fact, as there’s a reason that we joke our jobs are
              essentially done through “Ctrl+C” and “Ctrl+V.” This assignment
              was both good and bad for me for another of reasons, but overall,
              I still appreciate actually being able to bring together
              everything that I had done over the rest of the semester.
