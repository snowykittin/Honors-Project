              Three things were turned in for this assignment. An interview with
              questions and answers, a persona created off of those responses,
              and the scenario. One of the key things to remember when creating
              a persona is that it is not about the researcher. Instead, it is
              based off of the data from any questions asked during the
              interview. In the case of this assignment, students were asked to
              pretend they were working for the city tourism board. Focusing on
              how people use media and mobile devices when navigating the city,
              the interest was in understanding how people use media in their
              lives and so forth. Based upon this data, and the collected
              persona, a scenario based off of how local Indianapolis residents
              would use tourism kiosks was to be created. It was noted that the
              city had a basic idea how tourists would use the kiosks, but the
              main focus was how Indianapolis residents would use it. As such,
              the scenario was written from the persona's perspective, noting
              details about the kiosk in this scenario.

              Having to interview people and conduct research is probably one of
              my least favorite things in the world, to be quite honest. The
              idea of forced interactions in order to get an assignment done has
              always been something that I’ve struggled with, given that I fall
              into the category of being an introvert. However, even despite the
              social hurdle that I faced immediately going into this assignment,
              there was quite a bit to it that actually worked well within its
              own favor. I take quite a bit of enjoyment in being able to find
              the connections between various data sources. I'll go into them
              thinking of expecting one thing and finding several others, and
              this definitely happened in the case of this assignment. People
              are rather unpredictable, and that is probably the number one
              lesson I took out of this. I had also heard a little bit about the
              use of user personas prior to taking this course, as I was
              essentially our UX/UI developer for a few projects that I worked
              on in high school. We had to develop user cases for how our
              website would actually be used, doing a demo of it in the context
              of movies. So going into it, I had a bit of background knowledge,
              which made me feel a lot more comfortable with the assignment
              overall. Being able to choose online friends also made it
              significantly easier, as I am not someone with a lot of friends
              in-person. I’m getting better about that, but the access to people
              was a barrier I wasn’t anticipating having to think about at
              first.

              I enjoyed getting to design the persona and the kiosk scenario the
              most. Design is something that I don’t have the largest passion
              for, but I’ve got a large respect and interest in. I know that I’m
              not anything near a phenomenal designer, which is why I’ve opted
              for web design over graphics and illustrations, but I still
              appreciate the front-end, prettifying side of things. Getting to
              put together an “infographic” for my persona really honed in on
              that particular interest of mine. My passion for accessibility
              design also jumped out of nowhere when detailing the kiosk, as
              well. I found myself going into the accessibility details with
              quite a bit more enthusiasm than the rest of the kiosk’s
              functionality. As someone who has minor disabilities, I have a bit
              more reason to think about it than others. This actually ended up
              being something that carried through the actual design of the
              kiosk that was praised in a later assignment, but as that was part
              of a later assignment, the details for that will be found on
              another page.
            </p>

              If I had to redo this assignment, I would try to complete it using
              people actually within Indianapolis. As the kiosk was centered
              around people who lived in Indianapolis, I had to try to tailor my
              questions to be as location-neutral as possible in order to get
              the information that I needed. I also had to make quite a few
              assumptions when trying to apply my persona to the kiosk, as
              almost all of my questionnaire participants were not from
              Indianapolis. I’m a writer in my free time, and so I actually felt
              I did quite a good job describing the scenario. However, I would
              like to go more in-depth, getting a better scenario in my mind
              before actually going through with writing it. There were a few
              fundamental miscommunications that found their way into my
              scenario document, such as the fact that I pictured these kiosks
              existing on the corner of a street, rather than inside of a
              popular location. This was something I thought of when developing
              my prototype and took into account, but I would have liked to have
              this in my mind from the beginning. I feel this would have made it
              a lot easier.

              Understanding the concept of personas, their position within the
              development cycle, and their benefits is something that I will
              certainly be using in my future career. Whether I end up actually
              committing to the UX life, or even just going into software
              design, it’s really useful for determining the purpose and ways a
              product would be used. One thing I’m rather aware of as a
              developer is the fact that the programmer knows the tool
              perfectly, and that people don’t. That’s a bias that is almost
              impossible to fully get rid of. Even after leaving projects alone
              for years, I have come back to them with full knowledge of it.
              Having a persona that I can reference as a personality is
              extremely beneficial when working on any project, as it leads to
              questions and benefitting any product that may be produced.
              Striving to be better should be a quality of any company or
              project, and personas really help with that process. You have to
              know your userbase to design for them. After all, if you were
              developing a product for kindergarteners without realizing how
              much English they know, it could quickly end badly. It’d be like
              marketing Twilight to a kid who only listens to Baby Shark. It
              doesn’t work out very well.
