            According to the SoIC website for IUPUI, Students learn the
            fundamental principles and practices of human-computer interaction
            (HCI) and evaluation. Specific focus is given to the introductory
            knowledge of HCI methods, tools, and techniques for designing and
            evaluating user interfaces through the use of low and high fidelity
            prototypes for the Web and software. As stated in the syllabus, This
            course will introduce Informatics undergraduates to the fields of
            Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This focuses on the use of
            computing technology. From this perspective, we can understand how
            various technologies fit into users’ lives more effectively and can
            extend users’ cognitive capabilities through designing new
            experiences for them in HCI. The course will introduce you to the
            design process that accompanies software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, from the syllabus, the course is divided into two main
            activities of interaction designers. The first activity deals with
            the design process of software and hardware technology and the
            relation of our designs to the user. Examples of design include
            learning about our software users, sketching and brainstorming
            different design alternatives, and developing prototypes. The second
            important activity is the evaluation of the generated designs.
            Examples of evaluation include expert evaluation, usability studies,
            and field studies. There is a plethora of learning outcomes from
            this course. As detailed in the syllabus, one of the most
            foundational outcomes are the understanding and ability to explain
            HCI basics, interaction design, and related areas. Another is to be
            able to understand and explain a user-centered approach to
            interaction design. Overall, the goal of the course was to be able
            to use several different evaluation techniques for performing basic
            usability studies or heuristic evaluations in order to generate new,
            more effective design concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design process is something that all software engineers will
            encounter no matter what corner of software engineering they find
            themselves in. As someone who has demonstrated interest both in User
            Experience research, as well as software programming, being able to
            understand both is extremely important to me for the value of
            communication between teams, as well as being able to better
            understand what it is my coworkers bring to the table. As such, this
            project is dedicated to delving further into the mind of a User
            Experience (UX) mindset, while combining it with the software
            programming side that I have also been honing my skills in.

                The main focus surrounding this assignment was personas and
                scenarios. Tasked with interviewing five friends, students then
                had to create them into a single persona. A persona is a fictive
                user with goals, motivations, and challenges that may be
                encountered while interacting with a website. Their particular
                use is being able to remotely develop usage scenarios for
                products without actually having to go out and find real people.
                The given scenario, which would be continued throughout the rest
                of the semester, was to find a way to help create a service
                kiosk for members of a city to use to aid in tourist activities.
                Given that it was for natives to the area, it had to have
                features that would appeal to people who both didn't and did
                already live in the area.

                Building off of Assignment 1, this introduced the concept of
                wireframing. Prototypes can be extremely useful in being able to
                translate things in the brain to on paper, and helps
                particularly in making sure a team is on the same page about a
                design. They are typically extremely low-fidelity, essentially
                being a mock-up of the basic shapes and structures of a program.
                With using Whimsical, notes about basic interactions are also
                able to be made. In this case, wireframing the kiosk in context
                of going through a single task was assigned. I chose to go for
                the route of walking through an event, all through reserving
                seats and purchasing tickets. This prototype would come into use
                for later assignments.

                This assignment saw a slight divergence from the kiosk-based
                activities done for Assignment 1 and 2. It focused on creating a
                Heuristic Evaluation for a website of student choosing.
                Heuristic evaluations are a way UX researchers are able to
                compare a website or design to a predefined set of expectations
                that have generally been adopted by society. An example of this
                would be how everyone expects for the "X" to close something to
                be in the top right-hand corner if you are a Windows user, or
                top left-hand corner if you are a Mac user. For this particular
                heuristic evaluation, the Indianapolis Craigslist website was
                evaluated. There were quite a few interesting findings.
                Heuristic evaluations are a great way of showing inconsistencies
                in the design for how expectations may not be exactly aligning
                with what the designers intend. People tend to prefer not having
                to relearn things over and over, and so there has become a
                sub-conscious set of expectations found on the internet.

                Once more, students returned to the development of the tourist
                kiosk. Focusing on performing a usability test, students had to
                elect three people to test the designs they created in
                Assignment 2. The purpose of a usability test is exactly in the
                name: it checks whether or not the current design iteration is
                usable, as well as gives a chance for feedback to improve the
                design. These usability tests follow a set of questions to
                subconsciously guide a user through the program, but are worded
                in a way as to not force any opinions. In the case of this
                usability test, students had to walk their selected people
                through their prototypes with a set of questions they came up
                with. They then had to compile a report of their findings from
                these usability tests, and come up with suggestions to be able
                to improve the design.

            <div class="assignment-description">
              <p>
                Serving as the final project, this assignment pulled from
                elements of all the previous ones to create a high-fidelity,
                final mock-up of the travel kiosk. In particular, students
                focused on feedback from Professor Hofmann on Assignment 2, and
                the suggestions that were made by their usability testers from
                Assignment 4. On top of enhancing their prototype, students also
                had to introduce an error screen for a common error that might
                occur while using the kiosk. The purpose of UX research is to be
                able to take everything that has been discovered through
                feedback and testing and combine it into a final design that
                keeps in mind the original task of the product, but also
                functions in a way that people find pleasing and intuitive. As
                such, there is the expectation that students take everything
                they have learned into account when creating this.
